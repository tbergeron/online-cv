career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I've been developing customized mobile, web and software solutions using bleeding edge technologies for the past 10+ years. I've worked in multiple industries including medical/health, VoIP, VPN, web hosting, e-commerce, marketing, enterprise resource planning, automobile, metallurgy, and more.

      I can adapt to a team or work independently. I know my way around the full stack and love tackling difficult and complex challenges. I can also handle Linux & Windows server administration, virtualization management (AWS, Digital Ocean, etc), DNS management and more.
      
      I have good knowledge of legacy technologies and am very comfortable with any terminal / command line interface. I don't fear being pushed outside of my comfort zone and can handle project management & client relationships.
